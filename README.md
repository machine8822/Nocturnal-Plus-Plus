# Nocturnal--

## Interview Practice & Contribution Platform
**Project Description**

Nocturnal-- is a Java-based object-oriented system that models an interview preparation platform. Users can browse interview questions, submit answers, leave comments, and track their learning progress over time.

The system supports role-based behavior using internal flags (e.g., Admin and Contributor), allowing certain users to create and manage questions while all users can participate by answering and commenting.

The platform models core interactions between:

- Users
- Interview Questions
- Answers
- Comments

Voting mechanisms (upvotes and downvotes) allow answers and comments to reflect community feedback and perceived correctness.
